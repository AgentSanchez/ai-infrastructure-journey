A simple summary of struggles I come across as they happen. Partially a lessons learned kind of doc. It is very likely that I will end up splitting this doc amongst the summary of projects I've worked on.

- I struggled to get the RX580s on the old mining rig working with any meaningful modern workload (i.e. PyTorch) . AMD ROCm did not work out of the box as it is newer. There is some "after-market" support / repositories but I have not had the time to play with them. I instead will look for non-AI workload that I can run on them and manage through k8s and scheduling. I did however get successful detection from PyTorch , but I kept getting instruction fails. It may be worth changing the workload to a containerized version of what was originally running, i.e. POS validation nodes.
